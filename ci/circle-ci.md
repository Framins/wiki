# Circle CI

## Primary sections

    # circle.yml

    machine: adjusting the VM to your preferences and requirements
    checkout: checking out and cloning your git repo
    dependencies: setting up your project’s language-specific dependencies
    database: preparing the databases for your tests
    test: running your tests
    deployment: deploying your code to your web servers

* [Sample circle.yml file](https://circleci.com/docs/config-sample/)

## Concepts

* Each command is run in a separate shell. If you’d like to set an environment variable globally, you can specify them in the `machine` section
* Cannot read UI environment variables during the `machine: pre`
* Caching happens after the dependency step, so the directories that are specified in cache_directories must be available before then.
* A non-zero exit code during the setup sections (machine:, checkout:, dependencies:, database:) will cause the build to fail early. But all test commands will run, even if one fails.
* Deployment sections are triggered only after a successful (green) build.

## Default

* Base image: Ubuntu 12.04
* Timezone: UTC
* Databases: Postgres, MySQL, Redis and MongoDB
* Testing parallel directories: test/unit, test/integration, and test/functional
